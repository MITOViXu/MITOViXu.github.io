## Talking about excercise

### Q1: How often do you exercise?

**I don’t really exercise that much** (S + do/does not + adv + v + obj)  
**but then i do other forms of excercise** (Conj + Adv + S + V + Adj + N)  
**if you can take that into the category exercise** (Conj + Adv + S + V + Adj + N + PP)  
**So i like to dance, i like to do yoga, i like to go for a walk** (Conj + S + V + INF + V)  
**So i'm sure that's included in exercise** (Conj + S + V + S + V + PP)  
**So if you talk about that, i think every day at least an hour** (Conj + Cond + S + V + PP + S + V + Adv + Adv + N)  
**So yeah i do like to take care of my body and do like to invest in my body** (Conj(so) + Interj(yeah) + S(i) + Aux(do) + V(like) + INF(to take care of my body) + PP(of my body) + Conj(and) + Aux(do) + V(like) + INF(to invest in my body) + PP(in my body))

### Q2: What's your favorite excercise?

**So i think i like to say dance because it's mindless you don't realize you're exercising** (Conj + S + V + S + V + INF + N + Conj + S + V + S + V + N)  
**When you dancing it's just 1 hour catharsis** (Conj + S + V + PP + S + V + Adv + N)  
**You're just going and sweating it out** (S + Adv + V(is/are/am + V_ing) + Conj + V + O

```
Why V_ing:
Continuous Action and Parallel Actions:
When using V + ING forms with a conjunction like "and," it suggests that the actions are happening at the same time. Here, "going" and "sweating" are two actions occurring simultaneously.)
```

**and you don't realize you've worked out for an hour** (Conj + S + V + S + V + PP + Adv)

```
Why present perfect
Connection to the Present
Present Perfect: "You've worked out" (contracted form of "you have worked out") indicates that the action of working out started in the past and has relevance or effect in the present.
```

**So yeah, i think i'll say dance** (S + V + S + Aux + V + N)

### Q3: Are there any exercise you do not like?

**i wouldn't say i don't like, i do like lifting weights, but it's not one of my favorite part of the exercise.** (S + Aux + V + S + V + Conj + S + Aux + V + N, Conj + S + V + Neg + N + P(Preposition: of) + Det(determiner: my) + N(N + N: favorite part) + P + Det + N)  
**it's something which i find monotonous, something which i fine cumbersome, something which i find boring**(S + V + Det + N + Rel + S + V + Adj)

```
"which" (Rel): Introduces the relative clause providing additional information.
"I find monotonous" (S + V + Adj): The relative clause, where "I" is the subject, "find" is the verb, and "monotonous" is the adjective describing "something."
```

**So yes, ligting weight**

### Q4: Do you prefer to exercise indoors, or outdoors?

**I think both, when the weather allows, then outdoors**(S + V + N + Adv.Clause + Adv + Adj)

```
Adv.Clause: "when the weather allows"
Adv + Adj: "then outdoor"
```

**but otherwise i'm more of an indoor person**( Conj + Adv + S + V + Adj + P + Det + Adj + N)  
**i don't mind doing yoga every single day in my room**

```
Why V_ing:
after "mind," "enjoy," "avoid," "consider"
Ex:
- I don't mind helping you with your homework. She didn't mind waiting for the bus. Do you mind closing the window?...
- They enjoy playing soccer on weekends. He enjoys reading mystery novels. We enjoy cooking together as a family...
- She avoids eating fast food. They avoid talking about politics. I try to avoid driving during rush hour.
```

**I know like a lot of people don't enjoy that.**

```
Why is 'like' used?:
Ex:
- I was, like, really tired after the workout. She’s, like, my best friend. It’s, like, really hot today.
"Like" softens the statement, making it sound more conversational.
```

**I know like a lot of people don't enjoy that. They need an environment, they need a setup, they need to go to the gym, which is also indoors.**  
**But i do enjoy indoors and i do enjoy just exercising in my home, in my room.**  
**And that being said, I also enjoy working out in outside facility as well.**  
**Like, I like going for a walks, i like going for a run.**  
**So yeah, i think both.**
