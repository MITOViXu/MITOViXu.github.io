## Talking about excercise

### Q1: How often do you exercise?

**I donâ€™t really exercise that much** (S + do/does not + adv + v + obj)  
**but then i do other forms of excercise** (Conj + Adv + S + V + Adj + N)  
**if you can take that into the category exercise** (Conj + Adv + S + V + Adj + N + PP)  
**So i like to dance, i like to do yoga, i like to go for a walk** (Conj + S + V + INF + V)  
**So i'm sure that's included in exercise** (Conj + S + V + S + V + PP)  
**So if you talk about that, i think every day at least an hour** (Conj + Cond + S + V + PP + S + V + Adv + Adv + N)  
**So yeah i do like to take care of my body and do like to invest in my body** (Conj(so) + Interj(yeah) + S(i) + Aux(do) + V(like) + INF(to take care of my body) + PP(of my body) + Conj(and) + Aux(do) + V(like) + INF(to invest in my body) + PP(in my body))

#### Q2: What's your favorite excercise?

**So i think i like to say dance because it's mindless you don't realize you're exercising** (Conj + S + V + S + V + INF + N + Conj + S + V + S + V + N)  
**When you dancing it's just 1 hour catharsis** (Conj + S + V + PP + S + V + Adv + N)  
**You're just going and sweating it out** (S + Adv + V(is/are/am + V_ing) + Conj + V + O  
Why V_ing:  
Continuous Action and Parallel Actions:  
When using V + ING forms with a conjunction like "and," it suggests that the actions are happening at the same time. Here, "going" and "sweating" are two actions occurring simultaneously.)  
**and you don't realize you've worked out for an hour** (Conj + S + V + S + V + PP + Adv)  
Why present perfect  
Connection to the Present  
Present Perfect: "You've worked out" (contracted form of "you have worked out") indicates that the action of working out started in the past and has relevance or effect in the present.  
**So yeah, i think i'll say dance** (S + V + S + Aux + V + N)

#### Q3: Are there any exercise you do not like?

**i wouldn't say i don't like, i do like lifting weights, but it's not one of my favorite part of the exercise.** (S + Aux + V + S + V + Conj + S + Aux + V + N, Conj + S + V + Neg + N + P(Preposition: of) + Det(determiner: my) + N(N + N: favorite part) + P + Det + N)
