## Talking about excercise

### Q1: How often do you exercise?

<span>I donâ€™t really exercise that much</span>(S + do/does not + adv + v + obj)
<span>but then i do other forms of excercise</span>(Conj + Adv + S + V + Adj + N)
<span>if you can take that into the category exercise</span>(Conj + Adv + S + V + Adj + N + PP)
<span>So i like to dance, i like to do yoga, i like to go for a walk</span>(Conj + S + V + INF + V)
<span>So i'm sure that's included in exercise</span>(Conj + S + V + S + V + PP)
<span>So if you talk about that, i think every day at least an hour</span>(Conj + Cond + S + V + PP + S + V + Adv + Adv + N)
<span>So yeah i do like to take care of my body and do like to invest in my body</span>(Conj(so) + Interj(yeah) + S(i) + Aux(do) + V(like) + INF(to take care of my body) + PP(of my body) + Conj(and) + Aux(do) + V(like) + INF(to invest in my body) + PP(in my body))

#### Q2: What's your favorite excercise?

<span>So i think i like to say dance because it's mindless you don't realize you're exercising</span>(Conj + S + V + S + V + INF + N + Conj + S + V + S + V + N)
<span>When you dancing it's just 1 hour catharsis</span>(Conj + S + V + PP + S + V + Adv + N)
<span>You're just going and sweating it out</span>(S + Adv + V(is/are/am + V_ing) + Conj + V + O
Why V_ing:
Continuous Action and Parallel Actions:
When using V + ING forms with a conjunction like "and," it suggests that the actions are happening at the same time. Here, "going" and "sweating" are two actions occurring simultaneously.)
<span>and you don't realize you've worked out for an hour</span>(Conj + S + V + S + V + PP + Adv
Why present perfect
Connection to the Present
Present Perfect: "You've worked out" (contracted form of "you have worked out") indicates that the action of working out started in the past and has relevance or effect in the present.)
<span>So yeah, i think i'll say dance</span>(S + V + S + Aux + V + N)

#### Q3: Are there any exercise you do not like?

<span>i wouldn't say i don't like, i do like lifting weights, but it's not one of my favorite part of the exercise.</span>(S + Aux + V + S + V + Conj + S + Aux + V + N, Conj + S + V + Neg + N + P(Preposition: of) + Det(determiner: my) + N(N + N: favorite part) + P + Det + N)
