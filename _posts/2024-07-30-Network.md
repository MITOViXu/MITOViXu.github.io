## Introducing to networking  
### TCP/IP Networking model
![alt text](/assets/img/other/Network/Chapter1/tcp-ip-model.jpg)  
- TCP/IP uses RFC to define a protocols  
- TCP/IP model creates a set of rules that allows us to communicate freely as today.  
- TCP/IP (and another mo  dels) breaks the functions into a small number of categories called **Layers**.  
#### Application Layer  
- It is application software running on a computer.  
- The application layer does not define the application itself, but it defines services that application needed.  
- Example: application protocols **HTTP** defines how web browsers can pull the contents of a web page from a web server.  
- The application layer provides an interface between software running on a computer and the network itself.

#### Application Layer  
- The two transport layer protocols are the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and the **User Datagram Protocols (UDP)**  
- Transport layer provide services to the application layer protocols.  
- It decides how to application can transmit data on the network.  
  - TCP: reliable
  - UDP: best-effort  
#### Same Layer and Adjacent-Layer Interactions  
- Same-layer interaction on different computers.  
  - The two computers use a protocols to communicate with the samelayer on another computer. The protocol defines a header that communicates what each computer wants to do.  
- Adjacent-layer interaction on the same computer.  
  - On a single computer, one lower layer provides a services to the layer just above. The software or hardware that implements the higher layer that the next lower layer perform the needed function.

- The Variety of Ethernet Physical Layer Standards

**Consistent Behavior over All Links Using the Ethernet Data-Link Layer**  
- Ethernet acts like a single LAN technology because it uses the same data-link layer standard over all types of Ethernet physical links. That standard defines a common Ethernet header and trailer. No matter whether the data flows over a UTP cable or any kind of fiber cable, and no matter the speed, the data-link header and trailer use the same format.

**So, what is an Ethernet LAN ?**  
- Ethernet LAN is a combination of user devices, LAN switches, and different kinds of cabling. Each link can use different types of cables, at different speeds.  
### Sending data in Ethernet Networks  
**Ethernet Data-Link Protocols**
![alt text](/assets/img/other/Network/Chapter1/data-link-protocols.jpg)  
**Ethernet Addressing**  
- Ethernet addresses, also called Media Access Control (MAC) addresses
- 6-byte-long (48-bit-long binary numbers)
- For convenience, most computers list MAC addresses as 12-digit hexadecimal numbers
- Example: 0000.0C12.3456.
- Most MAC addresses represent a single NIC or other Ethernet port, so these addresses are often called a unicast Ethernet address
- All the unicast MAC addresses are unique 

**Other kinds of MAC address**  
- Broadcast address: Frames sent to this address should be delivered to all devices on the Ethernet LAN. It has a value of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.  
- Multicast addresses: Frames sent to a multicast Ethernet address will be copied and forwarded to a subset of the devices on the LAN that volunteers to receive frames sent to a specific multicast address.

**Error Detection with FCS**  
- Ethernet, like most data-link protocols, uses a field in the datalink trailer (Ethernet Frame Check Sequence - FCS) for the purpose of error detection  
- The sender applies a complex math formula to the frame before sending it, storing the result of the formula in the FCS field  
- The receiver applies the same math formula to the received frame.  
- The receiver then compares its own results with the sender's results. If the results are the same, the frame did not change; otherwise, an error occurred, and the receiver discards the frame.  
- Error detection does not also mean error recovery
